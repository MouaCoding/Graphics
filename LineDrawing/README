Notes:
  Simple Line Drawing Algorithms.  I used DDA and Bresenham's line drawing algorithms from the textbook:
  Computer Graphics with OpenGL by Hearn Baker

 - Used to help me find slope greater than 1

 - Vertical line method: I had to include a special case of when xEnd - x == 0
   if it was equal to 0, i didnt increment it.
   Also, instead of incrementing, i decremented for negative slope
